# CropGen - ML-Driven Plant Disease Detection

## Overview

CropGen is an AI-powered platform for **plant disease detection** that helps farmers and agritech stakeholders **identify crop diseases early** and take informed actions.

## Problem Statement

* Early disease detection is crucial for **reducing crop losses**.
* Traditional methods are **manual, slow, and error-prone**.
* CropGen automates **multi-class disease detection** using advanced ML models.

## My Contribution

* Designed and implemented **hierarchical multi-class disease detection models** (currently 100+ classes).
* Developed **multi-domain ML pipelines** integrating image-based and feature-based data.
* Improved **prediction accuracy and scalability** over baseline models.
* Collaborated with team on **product integration and real-world deployment considerations**.

## Tech Stack

* **ML / DL:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV
* **Modeling Techniques:** CNNs, Hierarchical Classification, Multi-Label Learning
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Web Integration:** Flask / FastAPI backend (interfacing with 4 developersâ€™ web platform)

## Architecture

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
2. Hierarchical Multi-Class Classification Pipeline
3. Model Training & Evaluation
4. Integration with Web Interface & API

## Results / Impact

* Built **100-class hierarchical model** in just 3 weeks.
* Achieved **baseline-beating accuracy** in plant disease detection.
* Enabled **scalable pipeline** for adding new crops and diseases.
